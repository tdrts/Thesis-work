## Music streaming mobile application with blockchain-based monetization system

My paper (graded 9.33/10) explored the possibility to create a new stream of income for music artists who face significant financial difficulties.

<br>

The app was developed with **Flutter (Dart)**, the blockchain part was done on Polygon having the smartcontract built with **Solidity**, the JSON metadata files were generated with **Python**, for the DB I used **NoSQL** and the minted NFTs could be viewed on OpenSea.

<br>

Traditional music industry rewards volume, but in this approach the connection that the artist is making with the audience is rewarded. 
The result is a mobile applications where fans can listen to music and support musicians with the help of blockchain technology by purchasing digital collectibles.
The application allows listeners to buy an NFTs (Non-fungible tokens) associated to lyrics, showing their appreciation for the craft. 
Users can bid on a certain lyric and in the end the highest bidder gets to have his profile close to the lyric in the app.
